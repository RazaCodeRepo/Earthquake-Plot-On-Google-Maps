# Earthquake-Plot-On-Google-Maps
This project graphically plots earthquake data onto Google Maps.

It makes use of the GoogleMaps API to create a highly interactive world map which can be zoomed out/in to any specific city
on the map. It then makes use of inheritance and polymorphism to create different graphical markers for denoting a wide variety of earthquake related information.

The entire source code is contained within a single file called EarthquakeCityMap.java.

A demo video of the software in action can be found at the following link:
